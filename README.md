# MazeProject
This is a language arts project I worked too hard on for some insane reason. I would not consider if finished, but it is acceptable for a English Project.

Uses DFS to generate a solvable maze every X seconds with a timer that slowly ticks down on you

### Why is all the code in one big mess of a file
Because it was too much of a problem to keep it seperate, and I was running out of time so I'm using this as a ~~temporary~~ fix. I know its poor practise, but this was the only thing I could make work.
